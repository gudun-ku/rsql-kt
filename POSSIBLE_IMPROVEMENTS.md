# Possible Improvements for RSQL-KT

Based on the current state of the codebase, recent performance tests, and general best practices, here are some proposed improvements for the RSQL-KT project:

## 1. Performance Optimization
- **Profiling**: Use JVM profilers (e.g., VisualVM, YourKit) to identify bottlenecks in parsing, especially for complex and very long expressions.
- **Parser Caching**: If certain expressions are parsed repeatedly, consider caching parsed ASTs for reuse.
- **Parallel Parsing**: For batch workloads, explore parallelizing parsing tasks to leverage multi-core CPUs.
- **Lexer/Parser Tuning**: Review ANTLR grammar for ambiguities or inefficiencies. Optimize token definitions and rules where possible.

## 2. Test Coverage & Quality
- **Expand Performance Suite**: Add more real-world and edge-case RSQL expressions to the performance test set.
- **Automated Regression Benchmarks**: Integrate performance tests into CI and track parsing times over time to catch regressions.
- **Property-Based Testing**: Use libraries like KotlinTest to generate and test a wide variety of random expressions.
- **Error Case Reporting**: Add tests for malformed input and measure parse error handling speed.

## 3. Usability & Reporting
- **Detailed Performance Reports**: Include additional metrics in the CSV (e.g., average, max, min parse times, memory usage if feasible).
- **Documentation**: Expand documentation for performance testing, tuning, and interpreting results.
- **Visualization**: Provide scripts or instructions to visualize CSV results (e.g., with Python/matplotlib or Excel charts).

## 4. Codebase & API Improvements
- **API Ergonomics**: Consider builder-style APIs or DSLs for constructing and manipulating ASTs.
- **Error Messages**: Improve exception messages for invalid expressions to aid debugging.
- **Dependency Updates**: Ensure all dependencies (ANTLR, Kotlin, JUnit, etc.) are up to date and compatible.

## 5. Other Suggestions
- **Cross-Language Benchmarks**: Compare parsing speed and correctness with other RSQL implementations (e.g., Java, JS).
- **Memory Profiling**: Track memory allocations during parsing to catch leaks or unnecessary allocations.
- **Grammar Documentation**: Auto-generate and publish readable documentation for the RSQL grammar.
